# Udacity's Explore Bike Share Data Project
### 2021-12-16


### Description
This R script is to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
The code is for answering three questions:
* Does Birth Year and Gender vary by User Type?
* Does Trip Duration depends on User Type?
* Does User Start.Time changes by User Type?


### Files used
Included in the repository:
* _Explore_bikeshare_data.R_

The explored data from Chicago, New York City, and Washington is not included. The data was provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns
